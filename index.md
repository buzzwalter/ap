# About Me
  I'm an experimental physicist and programming enthusiast.  Some of my interests include quantum computing, scientific computing, and experimental control systems.  The opportunities that computing brings to physics both excite me and motivate me to look for big ideas that seem to be missed in the whirlwind of big data and the modern computing infrastructure.  On the experimental side of things, I sometimes just get tired of sitting in a chair, and the peace and quite of humming vacuum pumps and hardware work re-center me.

# Places I've Ventured in My Career
* Arndt Group (2023/09 ~ )
  * Matter-wave Interferometry
    * Conducted laser desorption studies on photo-cleavables to understand potential control mechanism for collimation in Talbot-Lau interfometry based Matter-wave interference experiments. 
* XUV Laser/L-ALEPH (2023/02 ~ 2023/08)
  * High repitition rate kW average power Nd:YAG laser system.
    * Collaborated with engineers in designing and building vision interlock system to spot damage at kHz frame rate.  
    * Built diagnostics and auto-align systems into the beam-line to improve stability and performance.
