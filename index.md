# About Me
  I'm a passionate experimental physicist and an avid programming enthusiast. My journey in the realm of physics and computing is driven by a deep fascination with quantum information, scientific computing, and the intricate dance of experimental control systems. The incredible potential that computing brings to the table in the field of physics not only excites me but also propels me to explore the overlooked big ideas amidst the fast-paced world of big data and modern computing infrastructures.

  Beyond the theoretical, I find a unique sense of peace and focus in the more tactile aspects of my work. The gentle hum of vacuum pumps and the hands-on experience with hardware offer me a pleasant break and re-centering -- not to mention it's just fun to play with toys ðŸ˜„.

# Places I've Ventured in My Career
* Arndt Group (2023/09 ~ )
  *  I've embarked on an exploration of Matter-wave Interferometry here, delving into laser desorption studies of photo-cleavables. This work aims to uncover potential control mechanisms for improving Talbot-Lau interferometry-based Matter-wave interference experiments, pushing the boundaries of quantum mechanics experimentally. 
* XUV Laser/L-ALEPH (2023/02 ~ 2023/08)
  * My role focused on the High repetition rate kW average power Nd:YAG laser system. Collaborating closely with engineers, we designed and built a vision interlock system to detect damage at an unprecedented kHz frame rate. Additionally, I was instrumental in integrating diagnostics and auto-align systems into the beamline, significantly enhancing its stability and performance.
