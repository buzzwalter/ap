A fourier transform is a mathematical operation that converts a function from the time domain to the frequency domain. Here's an example using the display mode of the MathJax package

\\[
     \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-i\omega t} dt \label{eq:fourier}.
\\]

This fourier transform concerns the two conjugate variables \\(\omega\\) and \\(t\\).  This can be seen in equation \(\ref{eq:fourier}\) as a function of \\(t\\) and \\(\omega\\).
